#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = "Happy" + " Birthday"
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

b = 6 + 9 
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c = 19 - 8
print(c)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

d = 7.7 + 3.3
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

e = 4 * 5
print(e)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

f = "cheeseballs" * 4 
print(f)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 8/2
print(g)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 8.4 / 2.3
print(h)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

i = 5 % 4
print(i)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

j = 7 // 7
print(j)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

k = 8**4
print(k)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

l = 8 - 4
pint(l)
