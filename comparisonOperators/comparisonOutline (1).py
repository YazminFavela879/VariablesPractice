#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = "orange" == "orange"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a = 4 == 4 
print(a)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

b = 6 > 2
print(b)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

c = 4 < 17
print(c)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = 8 >= 8
print(d)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

e = 5 <= 6
print(e)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

f = 3 === 3 
print(f)
