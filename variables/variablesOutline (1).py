#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer
Friends = 6
#Float
Oranges = 9.3
#String
Item = "Lamp and chair"
#Boolean
Iphone = True
#List
Float = [3.5,5.8,8.9]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

a = 4
A = "Cheese"

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

x = 24




x = 123

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

A = "Cheese"

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green"]
flower = "Yellow"
#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:


name = "Yazmin" 
Yazmin = True

#7
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(A)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

 = "Mice"

animal == "Mice"
